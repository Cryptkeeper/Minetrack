## Updates
For updates and release notes, please read the [CHANGELOG](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

**Migrating to Minetrack 5?** See the [migration guide](docs/MIGRATING.md).

## Installation
1. Node 12.4.0+ is required (you can check your version using `node -v`)
2. Make sure everything is correct in ```config.json```.
3. Add/remove servers by editing the ```servers.json``` file
4. Run ```npm install```
5. Run ```npm run build``` (this bundles `assets/` into `dist/`)
6. Run ```node main.js``` to boot the system (may need sudo!)

(There's also ```install.sh``` and ```start.sh```, but they may not work for your OS.)

Database logging is disabled by default. You can enable it in ```config.json``` by setting ```logToDatabase``` to true.
This requires sqlite3 drivers to be installed.

## Docker
Minetrack can be built and run with Docker from this repository in several ways:

### Build and deploy directly with Docker
```
# build image with name minetrack and tag latest
docker build . --tag minetrack:latest

# start container, delete on exit
# publish container port 8080 on host port 80
docker run --rm --publish 80:8080 minetrack:latest
```

The published port can be changed by modifying the parameter argument, e.g.:  
* Publish to host port 8080: `--publish 8080:8080`  
* Publish to localhost (thus prohibiting external access): `--publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080`

### Build and deploy with docker-compose
```
# build and start service
docker-compose up --build

# stop service and remove artifacts
docker-compose down
```

## Nginx reverse proxy
The following configuration enables Nginx to act as reverse proxy for a Minetrack instance that is available at port 8080 on localhost:
```
server {
    server_name minetrack.example.net;
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    }
}
```
